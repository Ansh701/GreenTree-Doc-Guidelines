# GreenTree Document Naming Convention

## 📘 Introduction

This repository defines the official document naming convention for GreenTree to ensure consistency, clarity, and easy collaboration across departments using Microsoft 365 tools and GitHub. This standard applies to all documents related to training, questions, and internal documentation.

---

## 🧩 Naming Format

**Format:**
```
Training Topic - Document Descriptor (Type).extension
```

**Components:**
- `Training Topic`: Main subject or training (e.g., Cybersecurity Awareness)
- `Document Descriptor`: Brief description (e.g., Slides, Handout, Policy Query)
- `Type`: Either `(Training)` or `(Question)` — use capitalized in parentheses
- `extension`: File type (e.g., .docx, .pptx, .pdf)

---

## ✅ Examples

- `Cybersecurity Awareness - Slides (Training).pptx`
- `Cybersecurity Awareness - Handout (Training).pdf`
- `Cybersecurity Awareness - Phishing Policy Query (Question).docx`
- `Project Management - Introduction (Training).docx`
- `Project Management - Timeline Clarification (Question).docx`

## 📁 Storage Guidelines (Microsoft 365)

Follow this structure when saving documents:

| Type | Storage Folder |
|------|----------------|
| HR Docs | `HR SharePoint` |
| Technical Content | `Tech Employees` |
| Intern Content | `Intern` |
| Company-wide | `All Employees` |
| Finance, Legal, Marketing, etc. | `Non Tech / [Department]` |

---

## 🛠 Implementation in Microsoft 365

- Store in **OneDrive (drafts)** → then move to **SharePoint/Teams (final)**
- Use file name search like `(Training)` or `(Question)` to filter types
- Avoid using: `/ \ , * ? " < > |` in file names
- Keep name length under 100 characters

---

## 📚 Templates Included

This repository provides reusable templates:
- 📄 `Template - Training Document (Training).docx`
- 📄 `Template - Question Submission (Question).docx`

You can copy, rename, and use them as per your topic.

## 🚦 Compliance Rules
